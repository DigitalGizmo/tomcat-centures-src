                In a televised broadcast on May 8, 1972, President Richard Nixon
                announced that he had ordered the mining of North Vietnamese
                harbors. The objective was to cut off military supplies to Hanoi,
                the capitol of North Vietnam. The next day, an Associated Press
                article appearing in the <em>Greenfield Recorder</em>, a western Massachusetts
                newspaper, reported that while Washington awaited international
                response to the President&quot;s announcement, &quot;demonstrations against
                Nixon&quot;s action were in progress within hours on at least four
                of the nation&quot;s campuses.&quot;  Robert Romer recalls that the second
                time he protested at the Westover Air Force Base, &quot;the president
                of Amherst College decided to join the protest and there were
                quite a few hundred Amherst College faculty and students, and
                we all went down and sat together.&quot;  Amherst College President
                John William Ward wrote about his decision to the students of
                the college. His letter was published in the <em>New York Times</em> on
                March 13, 1972. He wrote, in part:</P>
              <P><EM>What I protest is not what has been done. What is done is
                  done. No word of mine, no word of yours will change it. What
                  I protest is what may come next. What I protest is there is
                  no way to protest. I speak out of frustration and deep despair.
                  John Dos Passos once wrote, &lsquo;we only have words against Power...&quot;
                  I do not think words will now change the minds of men in power
                  who make those decisions. I do not. Since I do not, I do not
                  care to write letters to the world. Instead, I will, for myself,
                  join in the act of passive civil disobedience...</EM> [More of this
