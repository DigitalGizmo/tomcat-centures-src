-- stripWhite does nothing but strip all unnecessary white space out of the activityList page,
-- in order to minimize its download size.  The human-readable page must be in same directory as
-- stripWhite, and it must be named "activityList(white).jsp".  stripWhite outputs a file called 
-- "activityList.jsp" in the same directory, overwriting any pre-existing file by that name.
